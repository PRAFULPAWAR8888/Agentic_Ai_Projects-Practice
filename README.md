# 📌 agent-ai-project-practice

This repository documents my journey of learning and building **practical AI Agent systems**.  
It includes hands-on practice, experiments, and real-world mini-projects using modern agent frameworks such as:

- OpenAI Agents  
- OpenAI ESDK (Everything SDK)  
- CrewAI  
- LangGraph  
- Autogen  
- MCP (Model Context Protocol)

The goal of this repository is to develop strong agentic-AI skills and build real projects that demonstrate autonomous reasoning, tool usage, workflow automation, and multi-agent collaboration.

## 🚀 What I Am Learning

### 🤖 Agent Fundamentals
- Understanding how AI agents work  
- Single-agent vs multi-agent systems  
- Reasoning patterns: CoT, ToT, planning, reflection  
- Designing autonomous task execution flows  

### 🛠️ Tool Usage & Function Calling
- Tool-calling agents  
- Designing custom tools/functions  
- Connecting agents with external APIs  
- File-handling and local automation  
- Creating agents that self-correct or retry  

### 🔁 Multi-Step Autonomous Workflows
- Planning → execution → evaluation loops  
- Breaking tasks into subtasks  
- Maintaining context and memory  
- Error recovery and iterative improvement  

### 🧩 Advanced Frameworks
- Building agents using the OpenAI ESDK  
- Multi-agent orchestration with CrewAI  
- Graph-based execution with LangGraph  
- Autonomous collaboration with Autogen  
- Integrating tools via MCP  

### 📂 Real-World Practice Projects
This repo includes structured agent projects such as:

- AI task planner agent  
- Research assistant agent  
- File-based automation agent  
- Document extraction and summarization agent  
- Data analysis agent  
- Multi-agent collaboration workflows  
- Productivity automation  

Each project helps improve problem-solving, tool design, reasoning, and real-world deployment patterns.
